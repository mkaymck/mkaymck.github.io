Hi! I'm Megan Mckenzie, a Data Science masters student at Dartmouth College studying and researching Artificial Intelligence.

My background includes 5 years of research and work in traditional AI as well as machine and deep learning, both in natural language processing and computer vision. Currently, I am studying robotic motion planning (kinematics, inverse differential kinematics, etc) and researching the application of deep learning for predicting seizure onset in patients with brain tumors at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center.

Previously, I studied computer science and chemistry at Smith College.

:warning: :hammer: Github currently under construction :hammer: :warning:

I graduate June 2024 and am excited for what's more to come in my career.
