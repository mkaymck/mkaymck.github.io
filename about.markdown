Hi! I'm Megan Mckenzie, a Data Science masters student at Dartmouth College studying and researching Artificial Intelligence. Previously, I studied computer science and chemistry at Smith College.

My background includes 4 years of research and work in traditional AI as well as machine and deep learning, both in natural language processing and computer vision. Currently, I am studying robotic motion planning (kinematics, inverse differential kinematics, etc) and researching the application of deep learning for predicting seizure onset in patients with brain tumors at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center.
