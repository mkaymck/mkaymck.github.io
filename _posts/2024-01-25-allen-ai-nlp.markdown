Hi! I'm Megan Mckenzie, a Data Science masters student at Dartmouth College studying and researching Artificial Intelligence. Previously, I studied computer science and chemistry at Smith College.

My background includes 5 years of research and work in traditional AI as well as machine and deep learning, both in natural language processing and computer vision. Currently, I am studying robotic motion planning (kinematics, inverse differential kinematics, etc) and researching the application of deep learning for predicting seizure onset in patients with brain tumors at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center.

In my spare time, I really enjoy golfing, reading inspiring books, and going on walks.
