Save for math camps in early childhood, my official introduction to the computer science field was in May of 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of my prior experience in biotechnology, I was asked to use AI as a tool to improve health outcomes in response to the public health emergency. Any and all background knowledge on respiratory illnesses was needed in order to help doctors and scientists achieve a timely solution.
I read hundreds of respiratory illness-related research abstracts and performed relationship extraction to produce a database containing relationships between entities from raw text. As a result, I was able to rapidly procure relevant and useful information for professionals at a rate of over 600 abstracts a day. This database would later be used as a search-engine style product for health professionals.
